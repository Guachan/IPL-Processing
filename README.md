# IPL-Processing


## Objectives of this Repository:


### 1) Rapidly calculate and plot linear/exponential/logarithmic regressions against the calibration standards to determine best fit

### 2) Extract the formulas of each regression and apply the best fit to the corresponding lipid class in environmental samples

### 3) Import injection volumes and concentrations with respect to the total lipid extract

### 4) Calculate the total IPL concentration and relative IPL concentrations according to lipid class

### 5) Plot the data in bar and line plots to summarize the overall distribution of IPLs
